  <Description>Add a three round burst to all precision rifles and moderately increase clip size.

This mod should be placed below whole-game translations, preferably above Xenonauts Fix Pack, because this mod replaces precision rifle descriptions.

Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition.
