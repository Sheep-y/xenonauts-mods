  <Description>Add burst fire to all pistols.

This mod should be placed below whole-game translations but above Xenonauts Fix Pack but, because this mod replaces pistol descriptions.

Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition.
