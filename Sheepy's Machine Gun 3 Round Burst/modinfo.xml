  <Description>Add 3-round burst to machine guns.

As a side effect, machine guns' full burst now fires 3 volleys of 3 bullets, and a 10/10 clip means 10 volleys.

This mod should be placed above Xenonauts Fix Pack but below whole-game translations, because it updates heavy weapon descriptions.

This mod includes the "Recoil 60" mod, which lower heavy weapon recoils from 70 to 60.
This is due to game engine's limitation which prevent mods from partially updating weapon descriptions.
