  <Description>Add 3-round burst to hand-held machine guns.
&#10;
&#10;As a side effect, machine guns' full burst now fires 3 volleys of 3 bullets, and a 10/10 clip means 10 volleys.
&#10;
&#10;This mod should be placed below whole-game translations, preferably above Xenonauts Fix Pack, because this mod replaces heavy weapon descriptions.
&#10;
&#10;Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition.
&#10;The "Recoil 60 Tweaks" mod, if enabled, will still have effect on the ground, despite that text descriptions will say recoil 70 because of this mod.
