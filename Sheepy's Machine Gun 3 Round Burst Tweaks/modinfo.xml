  <Description>Add 3-round burst to hand-held machine guns.

As a side effect, machine guns' full burst now fires 3 volleys of 3 bullets, and a 10/10 clip means 10 volleys.

This mod should be placed below whole-game translations, preferably above Xenonauts Fix Pack, because this mod replaces heavy weapon descriptions.

Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition.
The "Recoil 60 Tweaks" mod, if enabled, will still have effect on the ground, despite that text descriptions will say recoil 70 because of this mod.

* For vehicle burst fire, please try Armoured Assault.
