  <Description>This mod unlocks all weapons, armours, and equipments in the vanilla game, intended as a test platform for other mods.
&#10;
&#10;Aircrafts and vehicles are enabled immediately after Alien Invasion, and takes only 1 credit + 1 man day to produce.
Each hanger also accomodates one vechile, to allow vehicle when starting a new game.
&#10;
&#10;I can't seem to unlock advanced buildings.  If you know how please let me know.
&#10;
&#10;This mod is limited to X:CE.  It supports Armored Assault and should be placed above it, but does not depend on it.
