  <Description>Increase field of vision of Basic, Jackal, Buzzard, Hunter, Hyperion, and Aegis (if enabled and lower priority) to 135 degree, allowing three soldiers to cover all angles.
Vision cones of Wolf, Scimiter, and Predator remains unchanged.

This mod is language-independent.  Incompatible with Kabill's Cybernetic Armour because those has different angle of visions.
