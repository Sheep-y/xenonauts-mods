  <Description>Reduce the recoil of all machine guns and rockets to 60.
&#10;
&#10;This mod should be placed below whole-game translations, preferably above Xenonauts Fix Pack, because this mod replaces heavy weapon descriptions.
&#10;
&#10;Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition.
&#10;The "Machine Gun 3 Round Burst Tweaks" mod, if enabled, will replace description text to recoil 70, but this mod will still be effective on the ground.
