  <Description>Increase field of vision of Basic, Jackal, Buzzard, Hunter, Hyperion, and Aegis (if enabled and lower priority) to 135 degree, allowing three soldiers to cover all angles.
Vision cones of Wolf, Scimiter, and Predator remains unchanged at 90 or 60 degrees.  Aliens' vision cone also updated.
&#10;
&#10;This mod is language-independent.  Compatible with Aegis Armour, but incompatible with Kabill's Cybernetic Armour because those has their own set of angle of views.
&#10;
&#10;Sheepy's tweaks are mechanically compatible with each other in alphabetic order, and are compatible with and without Community Edition..
